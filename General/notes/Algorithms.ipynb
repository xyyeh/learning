    "#### Dijkstra vs Astar\n",
    "1. A* is just like Dijstra, the only difference is that A* tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra is using a BFS exploration of all paths\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Astar\n",
    "1. A* is optimal under two conditions:\n",
    "    - Using an admissible heuristic, i.e. the estimated cost from the heuristic is always lower than the real cost. The better it approximates the real cost, the fast the search is.\n",
    "    - Enough memory is available to find the solution and represent it.\n",
    "2. With an overestimating heuristic, A* would provide a faster albeit sub-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dijkstra\n",
    "1. If Dijkstra is used to find the shortest pat from a source vertex to all the other vertices in the graph, it would need to pass through all the vertices. If you only need to find the shortest path to a specific destination, then you do not need to visit all vertices.\n",
    "2. In the latter, it is the same as setting the edge cost to be 0 and using A*"
