    "### Dynamic movement primitives vs Stable estimator of dynamical system\n",
    "1. Though both DMP and SEDS represent robot motions as a DS, they are different in the way they encode a motion.\n",
    "<br> **SEDS > DMP**\n",
    "<br> a) SEDS model robot motions as a *time-independent* DS hance it is robust to temporal and spatial perturbations with any amplitude. In contrast, DMP is explicitly time-dependent through the canonical phase variable. To handle perturbations, higher level controller needs to reindex in time the canonical system\n",
    "<br> b) DMP is a one-shot learning algorithm, thus it cannot embed different ways of perfoming a task into a single model.\n",
    "<br> c) SEDS can learn from multiple demonstrations, it can thus generalize motion well in areas not covered with demonstrations.\n",
    "<br> **SEDS < DMP**\n",
    "<br> DMP being a one-shot learning algorithm learns faster. However, the execution time for both DMP and SEDS are the same."
