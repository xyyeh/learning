    "#### Direct Collocation Methods\n",
    "1. Direct collocation operates by transcribing a trajectory generation problem in to a nonlinear program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simple example: Consider moving a unit mass from rest at $x=0$ to stop at $x=1$ in $1$ second.\n",
    "<br> $$\\min_{u(t),x(t),v(t)} \\int_{0}^1 u^2 (\\tau) d\\tau$$\n",
    "<br> $$u^* = 6-12t, x^* = 3t^2 - 2t^3$$\n",
    "where the second euqation is found from calculus of variations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To begin, we need to discretize the trajectory, which gives a finite set of decision variables. This is done by setting up collocation points:\n",
    "$$t \\rightarrow t_0 ... t_k ... t_N$$\n",
    "$$x \\rightarrow x_0 ... x_k ... x_N$$\n",
    "$$v \\rightarrow v_0 ... v_k ... v_N$$\n",
    "Using trapezoidal collocation, we approximate the change in state in the continuous function $\\dot x = v$ as $x_{k+1}-x_k \\approx \\frac{1}{2} h_k (v_{k+1}+v_k)$. Also, for $\\ddot x = u$, we have $v_{k+1}-v_k \\approx \\frac{1}{2} h_k (u_{k+1}+u_k)$. The boundary conditions are $x_0 = v_0 = v_N = 0$ and $x_N = 1$. Discretizing the objective function, we have:\n",
    "<br> $$\\min_{u(t)} \\int_{t_0}^{t_N} u^2 (\\tau) d\\tau \\approx \\min_{u_0 .. u_N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} h_k (u_k^2+u_{k+1}^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Initialization* - to kickstart the nonlinear program, we need initial guesses. A simple trajectory for our problem is a ramp. Evaluating the guessed trajectory at each collocation point, we can obtain values to pass to the nonlinear program.\n"
