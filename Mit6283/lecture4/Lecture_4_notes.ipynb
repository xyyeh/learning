    "#### Continuous Dynamic Programming\n",
    "1. Mapping discrete time to continous time dynamic programming equations\n",
    "<br>$s[n+1] = f_d(s[n],a[n]) \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot x = f_c(x,u)$\n",
    "<br>$\\min_{a[]} \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0} g_d(s[n], a[n]) \\Longleftrightarrow \\min_{u()} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g_c (x,u) dt$\n",
    "<br>$\\forall s, J^*(s) = \\min_{a} [g_d(s[n], a[n]) + J^*(f_d(s,a))]  \\Longleftrightarrow \\forall x, 0 = \\min_{u} [g_c(x,u) + \\frac{\\partial J^*}{\\partial x}{f_c(x,u)}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The last equation is the HJB equation which happens to be a PDE. There is a lot of structure in the equation. With the optimal policy, $u*$, we have $-g_c(x,u*) = \\frac{\\partial J^*}{\\partial x}{f_c(x,u^*)}$. This tells us that the cost-to-go has to be changing over time at the same rate we are accruing cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The HJB sufficiency theorem does have a problem, it requires that the cost-to-go $J*$ has to be differentiable. There are ways to get around it, for example in the bang-bang controller for the double integrator system, there is, in fact, no vector fields that goes across the \"ridge\" and thus, we can just look at the paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Quadratic Regulator\n",
    "1. Another barrier to using HJB is the minimization over $u$. This is addressed by the LQR problem:\n",
    "<br> $\\dot x = Ax + Bu$\n",
    "<br> $g(x,u) = x^T Q x + u^T R u, R \\in \\mathbb{S}_{++}, Q \\in \\mathbb{S}_{+}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using a simple $J^*(x) = x^T S x,  S \\in \\mathbb{S}_{++} $ From the HJB euation, we have $$ 0 = \\min_{u} [g_c(x,u) + \\frac{\\partial J^*}{\\partial x}{f_c(x,u)}] = \\min_{u} [(x^T Q x + u^T R u) + 2 x^T S (Ax + Bu)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To minimize u, we can find $\\frac{\\partial []}{\\partial u} = 0$ leading to $u* = R^{-1} B^T Sx = -Kx$. Substituting this to HJB, we have $0 = Q-SBR^{-1}B^TS + A^T S + SA$ which is the continuous algebraic ricatti equation i.e. **care**. This is often solved numerically, i.e. $[K,S]=lqr(A,B,Q,R)$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since $\\frac{\\partial J*}{\\partial x} = 2 x^T S$, the controller $u*$ means the following:\n",
    "<br> $-\\frac{\\partial J*}{\\partial x}^T$ \"go downhill\"\n",
    "<br> $-B^T \\frac{\\partial J*}{\\partial x}$ \"modulated by my control authority\"\n",
    "<br> $-R^{-1} B^T \\frac{\\partial J*}{\\partial x}$ \"taking into account preference on actuators\"\n",
